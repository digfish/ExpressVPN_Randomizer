# NordVPN_Randomizer
Simple Python script that automatically chooses a random country from ExpressVPN's available country list and logs in to that server for you. 

Must have an active ExpressVPN account and Python 3 installed.

Only tested on Ubuntu Linux so far.

THIS IS THE FIST COMMIT, SOME THINGS MAY NOT WORK!
